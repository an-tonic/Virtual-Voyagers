## About the Project

VirtualVoyagers is a prototype of mobile application that transforms city exploration into a gamified scavenger hunt. Through the use of GPS, and gamified challenges, users are able to discover hidden landmarks, learn about the local history, and gather points. It will act as a platform for cities' tourism offices, authorities, and citizens, to develop and place 'Adventures' for discovering the hidden gems and bring revenue to small businesses, all while the users will get to interact with the culture ethically. While aimed at tourists, the application engages local users to discover their own city and connect with their culture. _This idea was presented at the [1st UN Citiverse Challenge](https://www.itu.int/metaverse/virtual-worlds/1st-un-citiverse-challenge/) and was shortlisted in the student category._
