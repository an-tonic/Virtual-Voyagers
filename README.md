# VirtualVoyagers

VirtualVoyagers is a mobile application that transforms city exploration into a gamified scavenger hunt. Through the use of GPS, and gamified challenges (e.g. visit of specified cultural destinations), users are able to discover hidden landmarks, learn about the local history, and enjoy an overall interactive adventure, all while gathering points for travelling in the designated landmarks.  

The app will act as a platform for different cities’ tourism offices, authorities, and even citizens, to develop and place “Adventures” in the form of treasure hunts that will allow users to discover the “hidden gems”, bring revenue to local-owned and small businesses, and interact with the culture in a more authentic way.  

The routes can be created by representatives of specific cities, either using volunteers (who can be easily found through schools, colleges and local businesses, since a lot of people are searching for ways to improve their CVs), or the funding available for tourism optimization to hire professional writers and photographers, in order to create engaging and entertaining experiences and potentially attract even more revenue. App users will also have the opportunity to create and share adventures of their own making, sharing their favourite places with the world, and thus helping us fulfill the goal of truly showing under appreciated locations.  

While it may seem that the app is specifically targeting tourists, one of the main goals is to attract local users, as well. Discovering your own city in a gamified way, and revealing new historical places, exhibits, shops, and even simply places someone else finds beautiful can help users connect to their own culture, thus further preserving it.
