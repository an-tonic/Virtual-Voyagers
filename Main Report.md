# VirtualVoyagers Application 

## Description

VirtualVoyagers is a mobile application that transforms city exploration into a gamified scavenger hunt. Through the use of GPS, and gamified challenges (e.g. visit of specified cultural destinations), users are able to discover hidden landmarks, learn about the local history, and enjoy an overall interactive adventure, all while gathering points by travelling in the designated landmarks.  

The application will also be able to act as a platform for different cities' tourism offices, authorities, and even citizens, to develop and place “Adventures” in the form of treasure hunts that will allow users to discover the “hidden gems”. Bring revenue to small, local-owned businesses, all while the users will get to interact with the culture ethically.  

The adventure routes can be created through the consultation of city representatives (e.g. tourist office employees), and volunteers (e.g. adventurers, travellers, locals). Thus, allowing the adventure routes created to be in existent places, in good neighbourhoods that are approved by the city (e.g. tourist office employees) and do not put the users in danger. The application recommends a specific route to reach the desired destination of the chosen adventure, but the users are free to take a different path. The application recommends safe routes, and rewards users that follow the recommended routes with additional points, to give an incentive to the users to follow the rules. Additional points are rewarded when users prefer environmentally friendly routes (e.g. bike lanes).  

Furthermore, for the creation of engaging and entertaining experiences the same city representatives (tourist office employees), and volunteers (adventurers, travellers, locals) will be consulted for brand new adventures. In the future works of the application, App users will also have the opportunity to create and share adventures of their own making, sharing their favourite places with the world, thus helping to fulfil the goal of truly showing underappreciated locations. 

While the application might seem aimed at tourists, a key goal is also to engage local users. Discovering their own city in a gamified way, and revealing new historical places, exhibits, and shops, uncovering mesmerising locations with breathtaking views and cultural experiences. Thus, allowing locals to further connect with their own culture, and appreciate the local gems.

## Application Page Details

 - **The home page:** Showcasing the user's current adventure, the progress of the adventure, and the amount of points the player has accumulated thus far. Also, new adventure recommendations according to the user's location. 

 - **The coupons page:** Showcasing a variety of sponsored discounts from online or local shops in the form of coupons. The coupons can be bought with the points the user has accumulated from their adventures (e.g. scavenger hunts). An example, 20% off your next purchase in Alphamega. The coupons are redeemable in the location of the shop or online, if they have a website. A barcode will be revealed to the user after the purchasing of the coupons, through their points.  

 - **The adventures page:** Showcasing all the available adventures, both the newly added as well as the recommended. The page is connected with the home page, simply by scrolling down, the adventure list is revealed. All the recommended treasure hunts are available in the user's location, which can be simply tracked by the user's phone's feature, 'location'. 

 - **The profile page:** Showcasing the user's profile information, such as username, and password. Additionally, the total points gathered, the total adventures completed, and the total places visited. The user will be able to change their password alter their username and check their overall progress in the application. The profile of each user is private, and other users cannot see for the user's safety (e.g. location, adventure currently taking, username).  

At a later stage, an in-app discussion forum page will be implemented, providing space for users all around the world to communicate, discuss and rate the routes; as well as an international leaderboard based on the points the users earn from completing the adventures. But further safety features will be added for the users' safety, such as randomly generated username within the forums.  

## The SDGs utilized 

The main Sustainable Development Goals this project is tackling are the following:

 - **SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities), SDG 13 (Climate Action):** The application encourages the use of sustainable transportation (e.g. bike lanes) by providing additional points to the users who follow the provided map. Thus, reducing air pollution and encouraging a greener way of travelling and discovering historical landmarks (e.g. local cultural history). A variety of adventures (e.g. scavenger hunts) are also recommended with nature paths, showcasing the local nature gems that the city the user is located in. Advertising adventures that require travelling by foot, and the appreciation of nature's gifts (e.g. waterfalls, forests).  

 - **SDG 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production):** The application allows for the attraction of ethical tourism both local and otherwise, by partaking in predesign adventures (e.g. scavenger hunts) in the city they are located in. The adventures provide routes with local landmarks and hidden cultural gems. Allowing the users to discover local businesses in less touristy regions and provide small local businesses recognition. Additionally, the application's future goal is the creation of a separate page on the application where travellers will be able to post their adventures and experiences with the app, allowing for local products to be promoted and sponsored via the app. 

 - **SDG 4 (Quality Education):** The application further promotes through the recommended adventures list, adventures with local historical landmarks throughout the chosen city. The travellers (e.g. users) will be able to experience the local history and a variety of educational locations (e.g. museums) by following the recommended routes. There are a variety of adventures to choose from. 

## Context

Tourism can have a strong impact on local culture, both positively and negatively, depending on how it's managed. This is especially important when considering small cities, villages and remote communities.  

In Ngadha village, Indonesia, the formation of a local management group has helped protect cultural traditions, while allowing the community to benefit from tourism. This group is made up of representatives from each clan and is responsible for organizing cultural performances and handling issues like corruption (Shahzalal, 2016). On the other hand, when tourism grows too quickly or without proper regulation, it can damage the social fabric of a place. Tourists may ignore local customs, disrespect sacred spaces, or reduce meaningful rituals to staged performances, all of which can lead to a loss of cultural identity (PS, 2017). In Pasir Angin village, tourism brought more income and opportunities, but it also raised the cost of living and didn't necessarily improve people's attitudes or infrastructure (Pramanik & Ingkadijaya, 2018).  

To make tourism more sustainable, local governments and industries should work together to support cultural preservation, provide community training, and create policies that ensure tourism benefits everyone involved.  

One of the main reasons the application's adventure routes are added after consultation of city representatives (e.g. tourist office employees), and volunteers (e.g. adventurers, travellers, locals) is for both the protection of locals as well as tourists. To ensure the locations chosen within the adventures and the businesses being advertised are both safe and representative of the culture, positively contributing to the local economy.  

By allowing users in the future works of the application to create their very own routes, the promotion of less known and tourist-focused locations will be brought to light too. Any locations that are unethical or do not comply with a safety measure/ policies will be taken down by the application, to ensure safe adventures to all the users. Also, in the user-posted adventures, a disclaimer on the very top of the page will be placed, informing the users to be careful and a checkmark will be placed next to each user-made adventure that has been checked and complies with the application safety measures (e.g. safe locations, safe route).

## Competitors

There are applications that work in a similar way, providing a platform for treasure hunts. The main competitors are GooseChase, Actionbound, and Scavify. Users of the listed applications identified a number of issues with the applications' usage through the apps rating on their respective sources. The VirtualVoyagers application, read through the competitors' user complains and comments and gathered information regarding the improvement and avoidance of certain types of handling. Meaning, the user complains were partly used as a guide for the creation of VirtualVoyagers.  

The main complains regarding the listed applications are the following: 

1) Several of the features are only available to paying users and advertising organisations.  

The VirtualVoyagers application is completely free for all the users, and no features are hidden or restricted. The goal is to provide a fun, immersive, culturally respectful exploration. 

2) The majority of the existing treasure hunt applications, require an internet connection in order to work.  

That can prove to be problematic for users coming from different countries, or user-made adventures that use routes that explore hiking trails, mountains, national parks, etc, that have not been approved and have little to no access to internet services. The VirtualVoyagers application can track the users' location through their phone (e.g. GPS) without the access to Wi-Fi. Additionally, the routes can be downloaded and followed offline.  

3) Interface is important for many users, and an unappealing interface can negatively affect user experience.  

The initial interface design of VirtualVoyagers application is minimalistic, high contrast, and employs simple but sleek-appearing elements. In the later stages, different application skins will be able to be added, allowing for a personalised touch. The traditional dark mode option will be added as well as a variety of different contrast colours will be provided. 

4) The related applications do not have a specific niche, nor do the creators monitor the content in any way.  

VirtualVoyagers is specifically designed for ethical tourism and local exploration, with clear goals and usage guidelines tailored to those purposes. Moreover, by implementing the international leaderboard and places for discussion and communication, the application will create a sense of community, as opposed to the competitors, where only players within the given challenge are aware of each other. Also, ethical exploration is enforced from the consultation of city representatives (e.g. tourist office employees), and volunteers (e.g. adventurers, travellers, locals). Additionally, the checkmarks next to the user-made adventures, inform other users of the validity of the posted adventures. 

## Funding 

Advertising revenue will provide the application's main funding. A subtle advertising technique was chosen to maintain the application's clean and adventurous aesthetic. The users will be able to collect points every time they successfully complete a scavenger hunt. Each scavenger hunt location will have appointed points according to the difficulty of the scavenger hunt. For example, if a scavenger hunt has more hidden gems (destinations) on the map than other scavenger hunts, it will provide the user with more points upon the hunt's completion. The total points gathered throughout the various hunts will be shown on the profile page. A coupon icon is located on the bottom taskbar of the application. Tapping the icon will direct the user to the Coupons page. There, all the points collected can be redeemed for discounts at local businesses or well-known stores. Thus, blatant advertisements and unskippable ads can be removed. Nonetheless, added revenue can be monetised in a classy and user-friendly way. In future works, the application will aim for further partnerships and additional income possibilities. An example of the future income prospects is through service partnerships. Other services like Airbnb or local hotels, could advertise their services through our application by being added to our scavenger hunts as 'resting stops', and not only as coupons to be redeemed. 'Resting spots' will be the locations in the scavenger hunts that provide the user with a place to rest, such as a hotel restaurant or an Airbnb location for the night. The 'resting spots' will be optional choices within the scavenger hunts that will provide additional points for collection. The dates that the location in the 'resting spots’ category will be available in a provided calendar. 

Sponsored adventures can also be a future revenue opportunity for local travellers, showcasing their experience with the application's adventure routes (scavenger hunts). Allowing for a separate page on the application dedicated specifically to travellers and their experiences, which in turn will allow for more visible sponsorships (e.g. sponsored products) and potentially attract even more revenue.

## Safety

Since the developers will not be able to personally verify the safety of all the adventures, the routes created by local authorities/tourism offices will have to be reviewed by themselves, as well as second parties, to ensure they meet the safety standards. 

User-added routes cannot be verified by VirtualVoyagers, so these will have a disclaimer stating exactly that, and encouraging users to use common sense and remove themselves from uncomfortable situations and places.  

Once the in-app forum will be implemented, we will also add the possibility to add comments and ratings to specific routes, so that the users who already completed them can warn others about any potential difficulties. Routes with user-reported low safety ratings will be removed by the app.  

## Inclusivity

With the expansion and improvement of the overall application, a number of inclusivity features will be added:  

 - Screen reader support (Appropriate elements labelling, Alt text for images)  

 - Different font sizes and an option to change the default font to a more dyslexia-friendly font  

 - Adventures specifically verified for wheelchair-friendly paths (recommended by local tourism offices) 

 - Audio support for a variety of languages 

 - Offline mode, without the need for an internet connect for maps 

 - Recommendations for solo travellers, and kid-friendly routes and adventures
